# Product Context

## Purpose

The E-commerce MCP service exists to bridge the gap between AI assistants and e-commerce platforms. It provides a standardized interface for AI models to interact with various e-commerce platforms (Aliexpress, Amazon, Temu, Ebay, Etsy), enabling seamless access to shop information, products, and review data.

## Problems Solved

1. **Fragmented E-commerce Ecosystem**

   - Different platforms have unique APIs and data structures
   - This MCP standardizes access across platforms, reducing integration complexity

2. **Limited AI Access to E-commerce Data**

   - AI assistants struggle to interact directly with e-commerce platforms
   - This service provides structured tools for retrieving and managing e-commerce data

3. **Review Management Challenges**

   - Merchants need to consolidate reviews from multiple platforms

4. **Cross-Platform Data Consistency**

   - This service normalizes data into consistent structures for easier processing

## User Experience Goals

1. **Conversational E-commerce Management**

   - Enable users to manage their e-commerce operations through natural language
   - Support multilingual interactions, allowing commands in different languages

2. **Simplified Multi-Platform Management**
