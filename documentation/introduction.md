# KudosiMCP - Introduction

## Purpose

KudosiMCP is a specialized server designed to analyze content from Jira and associated resources such as Confluence and GitLab. It serves as a middleware component that retrieves, analyzes, and delivers structured data from these platforms, with the additional capability to automatically implement requested features based on task specifications.

## Development Workflow

KudosiMCP follows a structured workflow for task analysis and implementation:

1. **Task Selection**: Automatically retrieves tasks from the current sprint with "Specify" or "Developing" status
2. **Content Analysis**: Parses and structures Jira task descriptions into logical sections (Background, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, etc.)
3. **Resource Integration**: Identifies and retrieves relevant content from linked Confluence pages and GitLab repositories
4. **Implementation Planning**: Develops a strategic approach to feature implementation based on requirements
5. **Code Generation**: Implements the required features according to specifications
6. **Validation**: Tests implementations against defined acceptance criteria

## Target Users

- Development teams requiring comprehensive understanding of Jira tasks and their requirements
- Project managers tracking implementation progress based on detailed Jira task analysis
- QA engineers who need automated implementation of features based on structured specifications
- Software engineers seeking to automate feature implementation based on task descriptions
- Organizations looking to streamline development through task analysis and automated implementation
