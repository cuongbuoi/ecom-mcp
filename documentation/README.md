# KudosiMCP Documentation

## Overview

KudosiMCP is a server designed to analyze Jira tasks and related resources, then automatically implement the requested features. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the system's functionality, requirements, and technical specifications.

## Documentation Contents

1. **[Introduction](introduction.md)**

   - Purpose of KudosiMCP
   - Target user demographics

2. **[Functional Requirements](functional-requirements.md)**

   - Structured Jira task analysis features
   - Confluence content integration
   - GitLab integration via Cyber Tester references
   - Automated feature implementation
   - Error handling capabilities
   - Authentication and security features

3. **[Technical Specifications](technical-specifications.md)**
   - JSON output formats for various analysis stages
   - Implementation result structures
   - Error and warning response formats
   - Error handling mechanisms

## Scrum Workflow Integration

KudosiMCP is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Scrum development methodology:

1. **Sprint Planning**: KudosiMCP analyzes the backlog to identify tasks ready for implementation
2. **Development Phase**:
   - Automatically retrieves tasks with "Specify" or "Developing" status
   - Processes only "User story" or "Task" type items
   - Analyzes task descriptions and acceptance criteria
3. **Implementation**:
   - Retrieves business context from linked Confluence pages
   - References code examples and implementations from GitLab links in Cyber Tester sections
   - Implements features according to specifications
4. **Testing**: Validates implementations against acceptance criteria
5. **Review**: Generates reports on implementation status and test results

This workflow integration ensures that KudosiMCP has access to all necessary information from Jira tasks, Confluence documentation, and GitLab code repositories to successfully implement required features.

## Using This Documentation

This documentation follows the Gherkin specification format, which is commonly used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). The Gherkin syntax uses a simple, readable structure that makes it easy to understand both the requirements and the expected behaviors of the system.

Each feature is described with scenarios that outline:

- The initial state (Given)
- The action being taken (When)
- The expected result (Then)

This format allows both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand how the system should behave under various conditions.

## Implementation Notes

The KudosiMCP server is designed with intelligence and reliability in mind. It implements industry best practices for:

- Structured parsing of Jira task descriptions
- Comprehensive analysis of requirements, backgrounds, and acceptance criteria
- Integration with multiple data sources (Jira, Confluence, GitLab)
- Smart code analysis for implementation planning
- Automated implementation of features based on requirements
- Testing and validation against acceptance criteria
- Secure credential management for multiple services

## API Usage Examples

For detailed examples of how to use the KudosiMCP API, please refer to the scenarios in the [Functional Requirements](functional-requirements.md) documentation.
