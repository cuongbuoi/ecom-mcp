## Known Issues

1. **Review Import Failures**

   - Some products with non-standard IDs fail during review import
   - Error 417 (Expectation Failed) occurs in some scenarios
   - Need to investigate API response structure for these cases

2. **Platform-Specific Limitations**

   - Some platforms have more limited API capabilities
   - Need to document platform-specific constraints
   - Some operations may not be available on all platforms

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Some error messages could be more descriptive
   - Need better handling of network timeouts
   - Some API errors are not properly categorized
